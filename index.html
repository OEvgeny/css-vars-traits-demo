      <h1>Versatile File Input Styling with CSS Variables</h1>
      <p>
        In this demo utilizes CSS variables are to manipulate the look and feel
        of an HTML file input element. The primary feature explored is CSS
        variables used in tandem with class selectors to create a rich array of
        styles. The base class, file-input, sets the foundation for every CSS
        variation. Once this base is set, additional *-var classes such as
        color-var, ghost-var, and border-var introduce unique traits for more
        customized use of the file inputs. These *-var classes introduce CSS
        variables that are then filled with desired values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various modifier classes, including primary, accent, semi, and thick,
        are demonstrated. primary and accent add distinctive colors to the file
        input when combined with the color-var class. semi and thick,
        demonstrate the versatility of border-var ghost-var by modifying border
        styles and the opacity of the file input. The emphasis of this demo is
        to showcase the power and flexibility provided by CSS variables. With a
        relatively small set of defined variables and classes, a significant
        variety of UI components can be created.
